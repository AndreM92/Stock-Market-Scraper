# Stock-Market-Scraper
This is my personal Python Web Scraper for Stocks that I wanted to share

### It includes:
- an import function to get the data of my portfolio
- code for creating DataFrames with Pandas
- the actual code for scraping Data from 'https://www.finanzen.net/' (a german page that provides realtime stock quotes)
- some calculations to find out my current depot value
- an export function to save the DataFrames in an Excel file

I also wrote code to append the data on an existing file to create some built-in graphs, 
but openpyxl always deletes my Excel commands :( 

This is a beginner project and will be updated from time to time
